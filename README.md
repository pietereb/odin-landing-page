# odin-landing-page
This landing page is a tutorial for The Odin Project.

The goal of the project was to build a webpage from a given design using HTML and CSS. The design to be reconstructed was given by The Odin Project and can be either found on their website or a local copy is also given in this repo.

During the project, we learned to apply basic CSS styling and to align all elements using Flexbox.
